Committing directly to the master branch in Github is not reccommended, commiting directly to the master increases the risk of break changes that can have a negative affect on the entire project. Also, when commiting something directly to the master, and you later realize a mistake it can be very difficult to revert.

I did not make any changes to my repo settings this far at step 6.
